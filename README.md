# Dark-Souls-Crosshair
A crosshair I wrote in python for Dark Souls for use with crossbows and spells

I believe i originally wrote this using PyQt4

At some point Python got and update and certain parts of the API for PyQT4 no longer functioned properly. I'm in the process of converting this to use PyQT5 

Or I may go back to PyQT4 if I can rewrite it using Python 2.7
